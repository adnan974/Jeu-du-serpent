# Jeu-du-serpent
## Description
This project was made to learn javascript. This is a classic snake game.

## Rules of the game
Each time the snake eats a piece of food, its tail grows longer, making the game increasingly difficult. The user controls the direction of the snake's head (up, down, left, or right), and the snake's body follows. The player cannot stop the snake from moving while the game is in progress.

## Running the app

```bash
$ npm start
```
